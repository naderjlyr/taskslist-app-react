Just a simple application to show my knowledge in react.

This is only frontend, no backend, no database or state management.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository and `cd` into its root directory
2. Run `yarn install` to install dependencies.(you can use npm install also)
3. Run `yarn start` from the project directory to run in development mode. (npm start also)

The application is served at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) by default.

## Testing

1. Run `yarn start` to run in development mode
2. Run `yarn cypress:run` to run end-to-end tests

## Usage

It's so simple, just enter the task name and press enter or click on the icon in the text field to add your task.
You can set the task to "completed" by checking the checkbox provided for each task in the list.

**Note:** Because of there is no database storage etc, tasks will be gone on page refresh.
